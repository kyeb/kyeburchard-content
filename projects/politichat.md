Politichat is a queue-style video chat platform where constituents can virtually line up to speak with a candidate, allowing candidates to have personal, virtual conversations that support their campaigns. We fill the technology gap between large, impersonal livestreamed virtual rallies and low-throughput, high-impact individual conversations.

Check out our homepage [here](https://politi.chat/). Originally a project for CS91r at Harvard.
